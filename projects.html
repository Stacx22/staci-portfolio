  <!-- 1. Fertility Outcomes Prediction -->
  <section class="project">
    <h2>Fertility Outcomes Prediction</h2>
    <p>
      Built an R-based supervised learning pipeline using tidymodels to predict altered fertility
      outcomes from lifestyle and health-related variables. Compared logistic regression, random
      forest, and XGBoost models, with a focus on interpretability, model evaluation, and ethical
      use of health data.

  <!-- 2. Rossmann Store Sales Forecasting -->
  <section class="project">
    <h2>Rossmann Store Sales Forecasting</h2>
    <p>
      Forecasted daily store sales using historical transaction data, promotions, and calendar
      features. Implemented regression-based models and tree-based ensembles in Python to support
      staffing, inventory, and promotional planning decisions, with performance measured using RMSE
      and MAPE.

  <!-- 3. Telecom Customer Churn Modeling -->
  <section class="project">
    <h2>Telecom Customer Churn Modeling</h2>
    <p>
      Developed a logistic regression churn model to identify high-risk telecom customers using
      demographic, billing, and service usage features. Focused on interpretable coefficients,
      confusion matrix analysis, and ROC AUC to support targeted retention strategies that are
      transparent to business stakeholders.

  <!-- 4. Apple Quality Prediction -->
  <section class="project">
    <h2>Apple Quality Prediction</h2>
    <p>
      Used the <em>apple_quality.xlsx</em> dataset to predict apple quality from physical and sensory
      attributes such as sweetness, crunchiness, juiciness, and acidity. Implemented both regression
      and classification models, with random forest identification of sweetness and crunchiness as
      key drivers of perceived quality.

  <!-- 5. Childcare Costs & Socioeconomic Patterns -->
  <section class="project">
    <h2>Childcare Costs & Socioeconomic Patterns</h2>
    <p>
      Analyzed the National Database of Childcare Prices to understand how childcare costs vary by
      age group, provider type, and geography, and how these trends relate to female unemployment.
      Delivered insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard and static R-based visuals.

  <!-- 6. White House Visitor Logs Dashboard -->
  <section class="project">
    <h2>White House Visitor Logs Dashboard</h2>
    <p>
      Created a Python-based dashboard to explore patterns in White House visitor access records,
      focusing on timing, frequency, and location of visits. Applied thoughtful visual design and
      ethics to support civic transparency without exposing individual-level details.

  <!-- 7. Kia & Hyundai Theft Visualization -->
  <section class="project">
    <h2>Kia & Hyundai Theft Visualization</h2>
    <p>
      Built an R Markdown report with six visuals to communicate the rise of Kia and Hyundai thefts
      across U.S. cities. Included pie, donut, stacked bar, treemap, area, and stacked area charts
      tailored to municipal decision-makers and law enforcement analysts.

  <!-- 8. Lottery Trends Across U.S. Games -->
  <section class="project">
    <h2>Lottery Trends Across U.S. Games</h2>
    <p>
      Used Power BI to analyze winning-number patterns for Mega Millions, Powerball, and Pick 10.
      Created histograms, density plots, scatterplots, small multiples, bubble charts, and donut
      charts to explore randomness and promote transparency in public lottery systems.
